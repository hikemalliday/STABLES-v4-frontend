# STABLES-V4-FRONTEND
#### An inventory parser and spellbook parser for Everquest (a MMORPG)

Created with VueJS, FastAPI, PyJWT, and MSSQL.

Despite the new date on the repo, this is an older app I created. I figured I would throw it onto my github to have a larger project count displayed. It is my first project to have a login system with JWT's. 
It is V4, because over time I made many versions of this app, with the very first being a vanilla JS version.
The app is desecrated, in the sense that my [STABLESPythonGUI](https://github.com/hikemalliday/STABLESPythonGUI) does everything thing app does and a lot more.
Backend repo is located here: [backend](https://github.com/hikemalliday/STABLES-v4-backend)
